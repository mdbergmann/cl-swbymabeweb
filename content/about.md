Passionate about software development, programming and software design - that's me.

I like writing clean code. Not only because I think it helps others understand the code better, but also companies profit as, in the long term, features will be developed more quickly.

But the main point is: it is the right thing to do. The times when programmers tried to make themselves indispensable with writing code that only they understood is over. Code is valuable to the businesses we work for. So we programmers should try to write code as clean as possible.

But what is 'clean-code'? Isn't this subjective?  
No, it is not. Start with Robert C. Martin's book 'Clean-Code'. It describes principles that are today more and more commonly accepted.

I like good software-design and I strive to know more and do better. That means I follow and apply the principles of SOLID and various software patterns. That also includes Hexagonal/Clean Architecture. I try to think of the bigger picture of the software, looking at it from a higher-level.

I do practice the discipline of test-driven development (TDD). It is part of my daily job since ca. 2014 and I must say that I wouldn't want to do serious development without TDD anymore.  
Why? Because it is a superior technique to reduce software defects to a minimum. Also does it help with designing testable, separated and decoupled code.

Furthermore, I like agile software-development. As clean as possible. Extreme-programming in it's original form is mostly true to this.

I'm an advocate of software craftsmanship. It is a growing community of developers that adhere to the principles of master, journeyman and apprentice together with a mindset of teaching and learning and helping each other.  
But most of all does it bring back the principles of writing good software as they were envisioned by the people that did originally sign the Agile Manifesto.

My experience in software development ranges from simple bash scripts over assembler routines and Linux device drivers to large business applications with web UIs in the cloud with cluster and failover features.

I work extensively with the Java Virtual-Machine. Writing Java code since 2000, and Scala code since 2010. I've also looked at Kotlin, Clojure and other languages running on the JVM.

But, in addition I have also done large projects with Cocoa on macOS, iOS. Projects for and on Android. Projects in .Net with C# and ASP.Net, C++, C, Python.

I like Ruby. It is an elegant language. However, so far I didn't really have opportunities to do a lot of work with it.

I also like Elixir. I've done a few small projects with it. It is a really attractive purely functional language with pure immutable data types, running on the battle proven Erlang VM.

As of late (in early 2019) I found the world of Common Lisp very intriguing. This web page was re-implemented lately in Common Lisp coming from Apache Wicket.

In 2003 I received the degree in computer science at the Georg Simon Ohm university in Nuremberg, Germany.
